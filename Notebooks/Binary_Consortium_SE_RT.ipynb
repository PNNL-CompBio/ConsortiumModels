    "An alternative to running standard community optimization with `optimize()`, we can also use a `micom.workflows` method called `grow()`. This simulates growth of the organism while also simulating potential tradeoffs (between prioritizing community vs. individual growth). This method does not require our previously constructed `community` object, but rather the `manifest` we added earlier.\n",
